### About the game
What will you do if you find yourself in a dark, scary forest at night, with only you and your enemy? One of you survives. Both of you have a weapon and a means of illumination, and the odds are even. Choose your tactics: Search for the enemy? Then you will have to light a torch, since the woods are very dark at night, or hide in a secluded place and wait for him to come to you himself? There is a chance that you will be discovered. It's up to you which tactic to choose, the main thing is that this tactic will help you win. Game online for 2 players. 

### Mechanical
Very cool, comfortable, mechanical! If you watched the screenshots of the game, you might have noticed that there are no buttons. Yes, indeed, there are none! (except for the light button) All control is through gestures. For example, to run to the right you have to put your finger anywhere on the screen to the right and do not take away from where you spent it, if you take your finger off the screen the character will stop running.

### About the creation and challenges of the game
This is my first game, so do not judge harshly. It's still in development, so it's not finished yet. The hardest part of creating this game for me was coming up with the idea and adding the graphics. I am a programmer, so graphics issues are very difficult for me to solve. The price of the game is free, the best help you can do is to help create the graphics and fix bugs. Right now the bugs I found are: I use photon and for some reason it doesn't transfer data between players very fast, sometimes player can jump very high, map is not finished, optimization is needed. 

### Install instructions
In the folder assets are several archives (Tiles.rar, Templates.rar, Plugins.rar), which you must unpack to the same folder where there were these archives to make the game work.
